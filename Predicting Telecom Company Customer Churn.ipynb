    "1. Defining the question\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will seek to establish customer churn for Telco. The predction will be based on Telco data and wil also give in depth insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals agreeing to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The Metric for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to establish the factors that detemine the factors that determine whether an individual will churn or not. We will also make reccomendations to Telsos on ways they can use to ensure that they reach more people and increase their chances of getting positive response in effort to turn customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The Experimental Design\n",
    " Below are the steps taken in this analysis\n",
