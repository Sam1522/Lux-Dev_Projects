    "1. Defining the question\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution will seek to establish customer churn for Telco. The predction will be based on Telco data and wil also give in depth insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals agreeing to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The Metric for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to establish the factors that detemine the factors that determine whether an individual will churn or not. We will also make reccomendations to Telsos on ways they can use to ensure that they reach more people and increase their chances of getting positive response in effort to turn customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The Experimental Design\n",
    " Below are the steps taken in this analysis\n",
    " 1. loading the required libraries\n",
    " 2. Loading and previewing data\n",
    " 3. Cleaning the data\n",
    " 4. Univariate analysis\n",
    " 5. Bivariate analysis\n",
    " 6. Multivariate analysis\n",
    " 7. Implementing the solution by using the neccesary analysis(XGBoost)\n",
    " 8. Challenging the solution and giving insights on how improvements can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Data Relevance and Validation \n",
    "\n",
    "The data available is relevant for the intended analysis. It contains demographic information that is significant to determine customer churn for Telcos.\n",
    "The data will help us in answering the data analytic question on the demographic factors that affect customer churn for Telcos. The data will also enable predicting the customer churn. \n",
